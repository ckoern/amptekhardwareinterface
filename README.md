AmptekHardwareInterface
=======================
Implementation of [Amptek's](https://www.amptek.com) DP5 Protocol for controlling PX5/DP5 Digital Pulse Processors. The code is tested with both, the PX5/XR-100 combination and the X-123 CdTe and SDD detectors.

The low level communication is implemented in C++ and supports both Ethernet via UDP and USB communication. A autogenerated high-level interface python as well as a Device Server for the [Tango Controls](https://www.tango-controls.org) SCADA system is available, allowing simple integration into many synchrotron beamlines.

The low level implementation is based on [previous work](https://github.com/ALBA-Synchrotron/AmptekPX5DS) at the ALBA synchrotron. However, the communication layer has been completely redesigned for more stability and added support for USB connections, circumventing the bottleneck of the low speed base-10 ethernet PHY of the hardware.
This code is meant to be a mostly drop-in replacement of the original Tango server, therefore the same server name and many commands & attributes are used. So far, the SCA channels and the MCS mode is not implemented, if those are needed, the original code should be used.

Additionally, a basic simulator interface can be used during DAQ logic development if no hardware is available.
